Nebula stuff:

Nebulae use the same number of parameters as other resources, but with different intent.  Here's a template:

Resources	Nebula,x,y,z,shape,xxxxxxx.dist,tendrils,xSize,ySize,zSize,numChunks

eg
Resources	Nebula,0.0,0.0,0.0,Nebula,nebula.dist,50,10000,10000,10000,4000

x:		x coordinate of the nebulaís centre
y:		y coordinate of the nebulaís centre
z:		z coordinate of the nebulaís centre
shape: 		Nebula (the distribution shape. Normally this is cylinder or sphere but nebulae
		can only be of shape Nebula)
xxxxxxx.dist :	relative distribution of RUs throughout the nebula
tendrils : 	the number of "tendrils" in the nebula
xSize:		x axis length of the nebula
ySize:		y axis length of the nebula
zSize:		z axis length of the nebula
numChunks:	the seed value - best to leave at >= 60 * numTendrils, <= 100 * numTendrils

Nebulae aren't as flexible  about controlling the distribution as other resource types because of the extreme amount of randomness that goes into their construction: a vast cylindrical region thinly populated with nebulosity tendrils appears mostly identical to a vast rectangular region [box] populated similarly, and I found that too many constraints produce unappealing tendril bunching.  Nebulae tend to form in a cylindrical/spherical fashion, even given the box distribution.
