Determining what Ships to load:(See also Objects-Ships.txt)

Not all ships/resources/derelicts etc. need be loaded for every level.  Substantial savings in loading time and texture RAM can be realized by excluding some things from the load.  By default everything is loaded for every level.  If something is loaded in one level and not loaded the next, the space it occupied (in RAM and texture RAM) is freed for other uses.

Here is a listing of the new directives to control this:

ExcludeShips	race shiptype
eg
ExcludeShips	P1, P1MissileCorvette
ExcludeShips	R1, LightInterceptor

race:		R1,R2,P1,P2,P3,Traders.
shiptype:	any ship type valid for these races.
		shiptype can also be "All" which will exclude that entire race.

IncludeShips	race shiptype
eg
IncludeShips	P1MissileCorvette
IncludeShips	LightInterceptor (etc).

race:		R1,R2,P1,P2,P3,Traders.
shiptype:	any ship type valid for these races.
		shiptype can also be "All" which will include that entire race.

eg, to only load 1 pirate (a MissileCorvette) beyond the basic R1/R2 fleet

ExcludeShips	Traders,All
ExcludeShips	P3,All
ExcludeShips 	P2,All
ExcludeShips 	P1,All
IncludeShips 	P1,P1MissileCorvette


Determining what Resources to load:(See also Objects-Resources.txt)

Exclude		resourcetype
Include		resourcetype

eg
Exclude		Asteroid All
Include		Asteroid2

resourcetype:	Asteroid0, Asteroid1, Asteroid2, Asteroid3, Asteroid4
		DustCloud0, DustCloud1, DustCloud2, DustCloud3, DustCloud4
		GasCloud0, GasCloud1, GasCloud2, GasCloud3, GasCloud4
		Nebula0, Nebula1, Nebula2, Nebula3, Nebula4
		HeadShotAsteroidR1, HeadShotAsteroidR2

		Note: don't load the head shot asteroids, they're really big 

		ExcludeAsteroid	HeadShotAsteroidR1
		ExcludeAsteroid	HeadShotAsteroidR2


Determining what Derelicts to load:(See also Objects-Derelicts.txt)

ExcludeDerelict	derelicttype
IncludeDerelict	derelicttype

derelicttype:	Fragment, Ghostship, Shipwreck

		Note: don't load all the derelicts

		ExcludeDerelict	Fragment All
		ExcludeDerelict ShipWreck All

		then specify what to load


Determining what colorSchemes a ship can be:

By default, the color scheme of a ship is based on it's race.

Race				Default colour scheme
R1 (Kushan)				0
R2 (Taiidan)				1
P1 (Turanic Raiders)			4
P2 (Kadeshi Garden Protectors)		5
P3 (T-Mat)				6
Traders (Bentusi & assorted)		7

In order for your fancy color scheme to show up, you must enable it for every ship that will use it by using this directive:

AvailableColorSchemes   race type scheme#[scheme#[...]]
eg
AvailableColorSchemes   P1 All 3
AvailableColorSchemes   P1 P1MissileCorvette 6 (for pirates of a purple color)
AvailableColorSchemes   R1 MissileDestroyer 0,1,7

race:	any valid race
type:	any ship valid for that race or "All"

Changing the BaseColor(sets the base colour of ships) use: 

BaseColor	raceNum,red,green,blue
eg
BaseColor	7,255,0,0

Changing the StripColor(sets the stripe colours of ships) use: 

StripColor	raceNum,red,green,blue
eg
StripColor	0,0,0

So, now colour 7 has been replaced with a Red overall colour with Black strips.


To the Mothership file adding:

Ships	Label,-3000.0,-2500.0,0.0,-90.0,R1,MissileDestroyer,1,?|?|colorScheme(7)
Ships	Label,-3500.0,-2500.0,0.0,-90.0,R1,MissileDestroyer,1,?|?|colorScheme(1)
Ships	Label,-3000,-5000,0,90,P1,P1MissileCorvette,5,DELTA_FORMATION|?|colorScheme(6)

Makes a mission sphere with 2 funky-colored missile destroyers and a formation of purple pirates.
