------------------------------------

Released 22nd December 2000

This Readme accompanies the zip file for The Complete Homeworld Map Makers Primer (HW-Primer.zip). Unzip this folder into any directory, preferably one you will be able to access quickly and often, (ie your Homeworld Directory works quite well). 

This Zip file Contains:

The Homeworld Map Makers Primer (html v2.1)
---------------------------------------
The Primer itself in glorious html format for use with your browser, a shortcut key has been added in the main primer directory, just click to start the primer. The files are stored in the HWP-html Folder.


The Homeworld Map Makers Primer (text v2.1)
---------------------------------------
The text files of the primer, added in case you want to print out a hardcopy etc, here for your perusal written with Word-2000, so should be backwards compatible to both word and lotus etc. The txt file originals I used to format the html (v2.1) have been helpfully added. These files are all stored in the HWP-text Folder.


HW Quick Reference Files
---------------------
Includes handy quick reference files covering all the gritty details you would normally need to trawl the primer for in simple txt formats for easy and quick access when building maps. Also includes the Relic Object lists, and TAKER's Error troubleshooting Guide, Hellhawks checklists as well as other useful documents that may or may not be interesting.


HW The Tutorial Map Files
----------------------
If you follw the tutorial given all the files you need and are used are here, also at no extra cost to you is the completed article, the Map 'Revelations' in its full glory, should you get lost in the tutorial or want to compare your result with mine.


Further help Files
------------------
Helpful Texts gleaned from the net Includes: TAKERs original file 'An introduction to Map Building'; Obitthrawns 'Homeworld Mapmaking Help and FAQ'; Hellhawk's 'Checklist for Advanced Map-Builders'; Mission Man Editing Steps by Roons and other Relic Board gems from yesteryear; and the original 'Gary's notes' files dealing with the Properties values. These have all been absorbed into the primer itself, but they are here for historical reasons. Trigonometry help files have been added so you too can relearn SOHCAHTOA like I had to do! These are the files that re-taught me, they may be useful.
