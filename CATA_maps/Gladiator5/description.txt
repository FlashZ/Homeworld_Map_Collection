Description	    **EDITED BY WR&AITH_&X SO BEAST CAN PLAY AND USE DFF** I made this map at a request that I design a map where there is one player in the middle and the surrounding players all fire their siege cannons at him. I thought it was an amusing idea, but not worth making a whole new map for, so I altered the CQ Siege Wars map originally created by KayosoniPSA.
Description
Description	    GAMEPLAY: The perimiter players all ally up against the guy in the center and try to blow the crap out of him. Then the remaining players can either ally dffa style or just kill each other off in an ffa.
Description	    SETTINGS: Regular siege wars settings (large bounties, no injects, etc.)
Description	    STRATEGY: There is one small crystal in front of each of the perimeter Command Ships which is basically the only source of immediate resources. Most of the asteroids and large crystals are in the center which gives the "Gladiator" a slight advantage in control. Perhaps the perimeter players should wait before killing the "Gladiator" with siege cannons because that would mean the destruction of 80000 RUs worth of crystals, on the other hand, you don't want him too powerful...
