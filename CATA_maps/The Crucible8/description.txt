Description	    I made this map at a request from sub&t&o&f&u to design a map where there is one player in the middle and the surrounding players all fire their siege cannons at him. I thought it was an amusing idea so I made him a map. enjoy &:&)
Description
Description	    GAMEPLAY: The perimeter players all ally up against the guy in the center and try to blow the crap out of him. Then the remaining players can either ally dffa style or just kill each other off in an ffa.
Description	    RULES: There is only one rule - the outside allied players cannot build mimics or MCVs, since there is no way to prohibit the creation of mimics of some players but not others, you must be honorable and follow the rule.
Description	    SETTINGS: Large Bounties, No Research, No Injections, No Crates, Large Starting RU, Allies, No Allied Victory
