Description	    You can now deselect the "Research" Option, but that means Taaw players start with siege.
Description
Description	    I made this on request of Static-X. He wanted a fighter-duel map with just fighters to practice micro-tactics.
Description
Description	    There are very few rus in the center and processors and carriers cannot be built which discourages rushing, so this game will be fought entirely with fighters. The crystals in the center further the discouragment of Beast rushers and add a bit of 3D-ish-ness to the map since you must either fly over/under/around crystals or blow them up wasting fighters.
Description
Description	    Included ships:
Description	    Somtaaw - Acolyte, ACV, Recon, Worker, CS and all modules 
Description	    Beast - Interceptor, Cloaked Fighter, Attack Bomber, Recon, Worker, CS and SU Modules; Unfortunately their is no way to stop the Beast from infecting and building Acolytes and ACVs, I've tried everything to exclude them, but when I try and a Beast infects them, the game desktops. If anyone knows how to fix theis problem (mainly turn off infect weapon) please tell me!

Description	WARNING!! THERE HAVE BEEN OCCURRENCES OF GAME CRASHES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO FIRE MISSILES FROM ACOLYTES!
