Description         I made this map for all the fans of my Death map. 1st I like to thank every body who has played Death and has helped make it  
Description       one of the top maps played in Cata. I made this map based off the map Death, and I am decating this map to all the players who love my Death map.   
Description         This  map is simlar to Death but the resouse patchs are not as big, and I put more of them in. I also added some cystals too. Over all I say this is a adv version of my map Death. If you liked my map Death I think you will like this map even more so. Well I made this map for every one who loves Death so enjoy this map as well.          Oh!! thanks for all the suport guys!!!!!
