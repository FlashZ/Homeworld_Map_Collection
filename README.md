# Homeworld (1999) – Historic Multiplayer Map Collection  
*Preserving two decades of community creativity ✧*

## 🍁 About  
This repository is an **archive of fan‑made multiplayer maps for the original *Homeworld*** (1999, v1.05 GOTY).  
Many of these files circulated on relicnews.com, WON, and early clan websites in the 2000‑2005 era and are increasingly hard to find.  
Everything here is provided *as‑is* for historical and educational purposes.
